# Project 3: Semantic Definitions - Report

## Abilities of the parser

This parser can generate symbol table and check whether the code has semantic error in C-- language.
For example, it can detect the variable was declared or not, or check the operand type is correct.

## Changes

I modify lex.l and parser.y.
In the lex.l, I let some terminal will set yylval for different situation.
In the parser.y, I modify lots of places. To make the project easier, I change C language to C++ language. 
I use vector of symbol table to handle each different scopes. When enter a new scope, it will push a entry to the table.
